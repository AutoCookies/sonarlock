# SnapSync

SnapSync is a LAN file transfer tool. This repository currently provides the Phase 0 foundation: a minimal executable CLI, strict repository layout, CI quality gates, and tests that establish a stable baseline for future transfer features.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22+

## Build

```bash
make build
```

## Test

```bash
make test
```

## Run

```bash
./bin/snapsync version
```

Phase 1 will add transfer functionality.
